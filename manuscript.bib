The growing amount of genetic data available today is enabling us to infer the evolutionary history of secondary metabolite gene clusters and their encoded compounds. We are starting to understand patterns and mechanisms of how the enormous diversity of chemical compounds produced by nature has evolved and are able to use phylogenetic inference to facilitate functional predictions of involved enzymes. In this review, we highlight how phylogenetic methods can aid natural product discovery and predictions and demonstrate several examples how these have been used in the past. We are featuring a number of easy to use tools that aid tree building and analysis and are providing a short overview how to create and interpret a phylogenetic tree.},

  abstract = {Abstract             As privileged structures, natural products often display potent biological activities. However, the discovery of novel bioactive scaffolds is often hampered by the chemical complexity of the biological matrices they are found in. Large natural extract collections are thus extremely valuable for their chemical novelty potential but also complicated to exploit in the frame of drug-discovery projects. In the end, it is the pure chemical substances that are desired for structural determination purposes and bioactivity evaluation. Researchers interested in the exploration of large and chemodiverse extract collections should thus establish strategies aiming to efficiently tackle such chemical complexity and access these structures. Establishing carefully crafted digital layers documenting the spectral and chemical complexity as well as bioactivity results of natural extracts collections can help prioritize time-consuming but mandatory isolation efforts. In this note, we report the results of our initial exploration of a collection of 1,600 plant extracts in the frame of a drug-discovery effort. After describing the taxonomic coverage of this collection, we present the results of its liquid chromatography high-resolution mass spectrometric profiling and the exploitation of these profiles using computational solutions. The resulting annotated mass spectral dataset and associated chemical and taxonomic metadata are made available to the community, and data reuse cases are proposed. We are currently continuing our exploration of this plant extract collection for drug-discovery purposes (notably looking for novel antitrypanosomatids, anti-infective and prometabolic compounds) and ecometabolomics insights. We believe that such a dataset can be exploited and reused by researchers interested in computational natural products exploration.},

Recently, there has been increasing interest in utilizing other information sources, such as liquid chromatography (LC) retention time (RT), to improve identifications solely based on MS information, such as precursor mass-per-charge and tandem mass spectrometry (MS2).                                         Results               We put forward a probabilistic modelling framework to integrate MS and RT data of multiple features in an LC-MS experiment. We model the MS measurements and all pairwise retention order information as a Markov random field and use efficient approximate inference for scoring and ranking potential molecular structures. Our experiments show improved identification accuracy by combining MS2 data and retention orders using our approach, thereby outperforming state-of-the-art methods. Furthermore, we demonstrate the benefit of our model when only a subset of LC-MS features has MS2 measurements available besides MS1.

Liquid chromatography\textendash tandem mass spectrometry, one of the most widely used analysis platforms, can detect thousands of molecules in a sample, the vast majority of which remain unidentified even with best-of-class methods. Here we present LC-MS               2               Struct, a machine learning framework for structural annotation of small-molecule data arising from liquid chromatography\textendash tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS               2               ) measurements. LC-MS               2               Struct jointly predicts the annotations for a set of mass spectrometry features in a sample, using a novel structured prediction model trained to optimally combine the output of state-of-the-art MS               2               scorers and observed retention orders. We evaluate our method on a dataset covering all publicly available reversed-phase LC-MS               2               data in the MassBank reference database, including 4,327 molecules measured using 18 different LC conditions from 16 contributors, greatly expanding the chemical analytical space covered in previous multi-MS               2               scorer evaluations. LC-MS               2               Struct obtains significantly higher annotation accuracy than earlier methods and improves the annotation accuracy of state-of-the-art MS               2               scorers by up to 106\%. The use of stereochemistry-aware molecular fingerprints improves prediction performance, which highlights limitations in existing approaches and has strong implications for future computational LC-MS               2               developments.},

  abstract = {Proteomics promises to revolutionize cancer treatment and prevention by facilitating the discovery of molecular biomarkers. Progress has been impeded, however, by the small-sample, high-dimensional nature of proteomic data. We propose the application of a Bayesian approach to address this issue in classification of proteomic profiles generated by liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS). Our approach relies on a previously proposed model of the LC-MS experiment, as well as on the theory of the optimal Bayesian classifier (OBC). Computation of the OBC requires the combination of a likelihood-free methodology called approximate Bayesian computation (ABC) as well as Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling. Numerical experiments using synthetic LC-MS data based on an actual human proteome indicate that the proposed ABC-MCMC classification rule outperforms classical methods such as support vector machines, linear discriminant analysis, and 3-nearest neighbor classification rules in the case when sample size is small or the number of selected proteins used to classify is large.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Chemical descriptors encode the physicochemical and structural properties of small molecules, and they are at the core of chemoinformatics. The broad release of bioactivity data has prompted enriched representations of compounds, reaching beyond chemical structures and capturing their known biological properties. Unfortunately, bioactivity descriptors are not available for most small molecules, which limits their applicability to a few thousand well characterized compounds. Here we present a collection of deep neural networks able to infer bioactivity signatures for any compound of interest, even when little or no experimental information is available for them. Our signaturizers relate to bioactivities of 25 different types (including target profiles, cellular response and clinical outcomes) and can be used as drop-in replacements for chemical descriptors in day-to-day chemoinformatics tasks. Indeed, we illustrate how inferred bioactivity signatures are useful to navigate the chemical space in a biologically relevant manner, unveiling higher-order organization in natural product collections, and to enrich mostly uncharacterized chemical libraries for activity against the drug-orphan target Snail1. Moreover, we implement a battery of signature-activity relationship (SigAR) models and show a substantial improvement in performance, with respect to chemistry-based classifiers, across a series of biophysics and physiology activity prediction benchmarks.},

However, the usability of               p               -values is plagued by many misconceptions and inherent pitfalls. We here propose the use of Bayesian statistics to quantify evidence supporting different hypotheses and discriminate between the null hypothesis versus lack of statistical power.                                                Methods             We use metabolomics data from three independent human cohorts that studied plasma signatures of subjects with myalgic encephalomyelitis / chronic fatigue syndrome (ME/CFS). Data are publicly available, covering 84-197 subjects in each study with 562-888 identified metabolites of which 777 were common between two studies, and 93 compounds reported in all three studies. By comparing results from classic multiple regression against Bayesian multiple regression we show how Bayesian statistics incorporates results from one study as `prior information' into the next study, thereby improving the overall assessment of the likelihood of finding specific differences between plasma metabolite levels and disease outcomes in ME/CFS.                                   Results             Whereas using classic statistics and Benjamini-Hochberg FDR-corrections, study 1 detected 18 metabolic differences, study 2 detected no differences. Using Bayesian statistics on the same data, we found a high likelihood that 97 compounds were altered in concentration in study 2, after using the results of study 1 as prior distributions. These findings included lower levels of peroxisome-produced ether-lipids, higher levels of long chain, unsaturated triacylglycerides, and the presence of exposome compounds that are explained by difference in diet and medication between healthy subjects and ME/CFS patients. Although study 3 reported only 92 reported compounds in common with the other two studies, these major differences were confirmed. We also found that prostaglandin F2alpha, a lipid mediator of physiological relevance, was significantly reduced in ME/CFS patients across all three studies.                                   Conclusions             The use of Bayesian statistics led to biological conclusions from metabolomic data that were not found through the frequentist analytical approaches more commonly employed. We propose that Bayesian statistics to be highly useful for studies with similar research designs if similar metabolomic assays are used.},

Denoeud               et al.               sequenced the               Coffea canephora               (coffee) genome and identified a conserved gene order (see the Perspective by Zamir). Although this species underwent fewer genome duplications than related species, the relevant caffeine genes experienced tandem duplications that expanded their numbers within this species. Scientists have seen similar but independent expansions in distantly related species of tea and cacao, suggesting that caffeine might have played an adaptive role in coffee evolution.

We generated a high-quality draft genome of the species               Coffea canephora               , which displays a conserved chromosomal gene order among asterid angiosperms. Although it shows no sign of the whole-genome triplication identified in Solanaceae species such as tomato, the genome includes several species-specific gene family expansions, among them               N               -methyltransferases (NMTs) involved in caffeine production, defense-related genes, and alkaloid and flavonoid enzymes involved in secondary compound synthesis. Comparative analyses of caffeine NMTs demonstrate that these genes expanded through sequential tandem duplications independently of genes from cacao and tea, suggesting that caffeine in eudicots is of polyphyletic origin.},

  abstract = {Abstract                            Retention time information is used for metabolite annotation in metabolomic experiments. But its usefulness is hindered by the availability of experimental retention time data in metabolomic databases, and by the lack of reproducibility between different chromatographic methods. Accurate prediction of retention time for a given chromatographic method would be a valuable support for metabolite annotation. We have trained state-of-the-art machine learning regressors using the 80,~038 experimental retention times from the METLIN Small Molecule Retention Tim (SMRT) dataset. The models included deep neural networks, deep kernel learning, several gradient boosting models, and a blending approach. 5,~666 molecular descriptors and 2,~214 fingerprints (MACCS166, Extended Connectivity, and Path Fingerprints fingerprints) were generated with the alvaDesc software. The models were trained using only the descriptors, only the fingerprints, and both types of features simultaneously. Bayesian hyperparameter search was used for parameter tuning. To avoid data-leakage when reporting the performance metrics, nested cross-validation was employed. The best results were obtained by a heavily regularized deep neural network trained with cosine annealing warm restarts and stochastic weight averaging, achieving a mean and median absolute errors of                                                   \$\$39.2 \textbackslash pm 1.2\textbackslash; s\$\$                                                               39.2                       {$\pm$}                       1.2                                              s                                                                                       and                                                   \$\$17.2 \textbackslash pm 0.9\textbackslash;s\$\$                                                               17.2                       {$\pm$}                       0.9                                              s                                                                                       , respectively. To the best of our knowledge, these are the most accurate predictions published up to date over the SMRT dataset. To project retention times between chromatographic methods, a novel Bayesian meta-learning approach that can learn from just a few molecules is proposed. By applying this projection between the deep neural network retention time predictions and a given chromatographic method, our approach can be integrated into a metabolite annotation workflow to obtain z-scores for the candidate annotations. To this end, it is enough that just as few as 10 molecules of a given experiment have been identified (probably by using pure metabolite standards). The use of z-scores permits considering the uncertainty in the projection when ranking candidates, and not only the accuracy. In this scenario, our results show that in 68\% of the cases the correct molecule was among the top three candidates filtered by mass and ranked according to z-scores. This shows the usefulness of this information to support metabolite annotation. Python code is available on GitHub at https://github.com/constantino-garcia/cmmrt.},

Samples are usually analyzed by liquid chromatography coupled with fragmentation mass spectrometry to acquire informative mass spectral ensembles. Such data is then exploited to establish relationships among analytes or samples (e.g., via molecular networking) and annotate metabolites. However, the comparison of samples profiled in different batches is challenging with current metabolomics methods since the experimental variation\textemdash changes in chromatographical or mass spectrometric conditions - hinders the direct comparison of the profiled samples.

This method is particularly suited for heterogeneous and chemodiverse sample sets. MEMO demonstrated similar clustering performance as state-of-the-art metrics considering fragmentation spectra. More importantly, such performance was achieved without the requirement of a prior feature alignment step and in a significantly shorter computational time. MEMO thus allows the comparison of vast ensembles of samples, even when analyzed over long periods of time, and on different chromatographic or mass spectrometry platforms. This new addition to the computational metabolomics toolbox should drastically expand the scope of large-scale comparative analysis.},

  abstract = {Modern natural products (NPs) research relies on untargeted liquid chromatography coupled with mass spectrometry metabolomics. Together with cutting-edge processing and computational annotation strategies, such approaches can yield extensive spectral and structural information. However, current processing workflows require feature-alignment steps based on retention time which hinders the comparison of samples originating from different batches or analyzed using different instrumental setups. In addition, there is currently no analytical framework available to efficiently match processed metabolomics data and associated metadata with external resources. To address these limitations, we present a new sample-centric and knowledge-driven framework allowing multi-modal data alignment - e.g. through chemical structures, biological activities, or spectral features - and demonstrate its value in exploring large and chemodiverse natural extract datasets. Here, the experimental data is processed at the sample level, matched with external identifiers where possible, semantically enriched, and integrated into a unified knowledge graph. The use of semantic web technology enables comparison of processed and standardized data, information, and knowledge at the repository scale. We demonstrate the utility of the developed framework, the Experimental Natural Products Knowledge Graph (ENPKG), to leverage the results obtained from screening 1,600 plant extracts against trypanosomatids and streamline the identification of new antiparasitic compounds. Thanks to its versatility, the proposed approach allows for a radically novel exploitation of metabolomics data. Semantic web technologies are a fundamental asset and we anticipate that their adoption will complement the current computational metabolomics pipelines and enable the community to advance in the description of global chemodiversity and drug discovery projects.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Compound structural identification for non-targeted screening of organic molecules in complex mixtures is commonly carried out using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (UHPLC-HRMS/MS and related techniques). Instrumental developments in recent years have increased the quality and quantity of data available; however, using current data analysis methods, structures can be assigned to only a small fraction of compounds present in typical mixtures. We present a new data analysis pipeline, ``MSEI'', that harnesses data science methodologies to improve structural identification capabilities from tandem mass spectrometry data. In particular, feature vectors for fingerprint calculation are found directly from tandem mass spectra, strongly reducing computational costs, and fingerprint comparison uses an optimised methodology accounting for uncertainty to improve distinction between matching and non-matching compounds. MSEI builds on the identification of a small number of compounds through current state-of-the-art data analysis on UHPLC-HRMS/MS measurements and uses targeted training and tailored molecular fingerprints to focus identification to a particular molecular space of interest. Initial compound identifications are used as training data for a set of random forests which directly predict a custom 75-digit molecular fingerprint from a vectorised MS/MS spectrum. Kendrick mass defects (KMDs) for peaks as well as ``lost''~fragments removed during fragmentation were found to be useful information for fingerprint prediction. Fingerprints are then compared to potential matches from the PubChem structural database using Euclidean distance, with fingerprint digit weights determined using an SVM to maximise distance between matching and non-matching compounds. Potential matches are additionally filtered for hydrophobicity based on measured retention time, using a newly developed machine learning method for retention time prediction. MSEI was able to correctly assign {$>$} 50\% of structures in a test dataset and showed {$>$} 10\% better performance than current state-of-the-art methods, while using an order of magnitude less computational power and a fraction of the training data.},

Spec2Vec learns fragmental relationships within a large set of spectral data to derive abstract spectral embeddings that can be used to assess spectral similarities. Using data derived from GNPS MS/MS libraries including spectra for nearly 13,000 unique molecules, we show how Spec2Vec scores correlate better with structural similarity than cosine-based scores. We demonstrate the advantages of Spec2Vec in library matching and molecular networking. Spec2Vec is computationally more scalable allowing structural analogue searches in large databases within seconds.},

  abstract = {Liquid Chromatography Time-of-Flight Mass Spectrometry (LC-TOFMS) is an analytical platform that is widely used in the study of biological mixtures in the rapidly growing fields of proteomics and metabolomics. The development of statistical methods for the analysis of the very large data-sets that are typically produced in LC-TOFMS experiments is a very active area of research. However, the theoretical basis on which these methods are built is currently rather thin and as a result, inferences regarding the samples analysed are generally drawn in a somewhat qualitative fashion. This thesis concerns the development of a statistical formalism that can be used to describe and analyse the data produced in an LC-TOFMS experiment. This is done through the derivation of a number of probability distributions, each corresponding to a different level of approximation of the distribution of the empirically obtained data. Using such probabilistic models, statistically rigorous methods are developed and validated which are designed to address some of the central problems encountered in the practical analysis of LC-TOFMS data, most notably those related to the identification of unknown metabolites. Unlike most existing bioinformatics techniques, this work aims for rigour rather than generality. Consequently the methods developed are closely tailored to a particular type of TOF mass spectrometer, although they do carry over to other TOF instruments, albeit with important restrictions. And while the algorithms presented may constitute useful analytical tools for the mass spectrometers to which they can be applied, the broader implications of the general methodological approach that is taken are also of central importance. In particular, it is arguable that the main value of this work lies in its role as a proof-of-concept that detailed probabilistic modelling of TOFMS data is possible and can be used in practice to address important data analytical problems in a statistically rigorous manner.},

As the field of HRMS is quickly and permanently evolving, the aim of this work is to review its use in different aspects of metabolomics, including data acquisition, metabolite annotation, identification and quantification.

It enables the simulation of any biomolecule amenable to mass spectrometry (MS) since all calculations are based on chemical formulas. SMITER features a modular design, allowing for an easy implementation of different noise and fragmentation models. By default, SMITER uses an established noise model and offers several methods for peptide fragmentation, and two models for nucleoside fragmentation and one for lipid fragmentation. Due to the rich Python ecosystem, other modules, e.g., for retention time (RT) prediction, can easily be implemented for the tailored simulation of any molecule of choice. This facilitates the generation of defined gold-standard LC-MS/MS datasets for any type of experiment. Such gold standards, where the ground truth is known, are required in computational mass spectrometry to test new algorithms and to improve parameters of existing ones. Similarly, gold-standard datasets can be used to evaluate analytical challenges, e.g., by predicting co-elution and co-fragmentation of molecules. As these challenges hinder the detection or quantification of co-eluents, a comprehensive simulation can identify and thus, prevent such difficulties before performing actual MS experiments. SMITER allows the creation of such datasets easily, fast, and efficiently.},

  abstract = {Abstract           A central assumption of all machine learning is that the training data are an informative subset of the true distribution we want to learn. Yet, this assumption may be violated in practice. Recently, learning from the molecular structures of small molecules has moved into the focus of the machine learning community. Usually, those small molecules are of biological interest, such as metabolites or drugs. Applications include prediction of toxicity, ligand binding or retention time.           We investigate how well certain large-scale datasets cover the space of all known biomolecular structures. Investigation of coverage requires a sensible distance measure between molecular structures. We use a well-known distance measure based on solving the Maximum Common Edge Subgraph (MCES) problem, which agrees well with the chemical and biochemical intuition of similarity between compounds. Unfortunately, this computational problem is NP-hard, severely restricting the use of the corresponding distance measure in large-scale studies. We introduce an exact approach that combines Integer Linear Programming and intricate heuristic bounds to ensure efficient computations and dependable results.           We find that several large-scale datasets frequently used in this domain of machine learning are far from a uniform coverage of known biomolecular structures. This severely confines the predictive power of models trained on this data. Next, we propose two further approaches to check if a training dataset differs substantially from the distribution of known biomolecular structures. On the positive side, our methods may allow creators of large-scale datasets to identify regions in molecular structure space where it is advisable to provide additional training data.},

  abstract = {The remarkable diversity of specialized metabolites produced by plants has inspired several decades of research and nucleated a long list of theories to guide empirical ecological studies. However, analytical constraints and the lack of untargeted processing workflows have long precluded comprehensive metabolite profiling and, consequently, the collection of the critical currencies to test theory predictions for the ecological functions of plant metabolic diversity. Developments in mass spectrometry (MS) metabolomics have revolutionized the large-scale inventory and annotation of chemicals from biospecimens. Hence, the next generation of MS metabolomics propelled by new bioinformatics developments provides a long-awaited framework to revisit metabolism-centered ecological questions, much like the advances in next-generation sequencing of the last two decades impacted all research horizons in genomics. Here, we review advances in plant (computational) metabolomics to foster hypothesis formulation from complex metabolome data. Additionally, we reflect on how next-generation metabolomics could reinvigorate the testing of long-standing theories on plant metabolic diversity.},

It led to the selection of a sample-specific cluster of ions detected in the bark extract of               Codiaeum peltatum               . The MN-guided purification of the targeted compounds afforded four unprecedented chlorinated monoterpenyl quinolones named chloroaustralasines A\textendash C and isochloroaustralasine A. Faced with inconsistent spectral data of some previously reported quinolones, the total synthesis of the corresponding dihydroxy and chlorohydrin compounds was undertaken. The desired products were obtained in three steps, allowing the structural reassignment of two erioaustralasines. The chloroperoxidase-mediated hydroxychlorination reaction developed for the synthesis of the chlorinated quinolone showed that such complex molecules could be good substrates for this enzyme and, at the same time, raised the question of the biosynthetic origin of the non-artefactual chlorohydrin moiety.},

  abstract = {Abstract             Countless reports describe the isolation and structural characterization of natural products, yet this information remains disconnected and underutilized. Using a cheminformatics approach, we leverage the reported observations of iridoid glucosides with the known phylogeny of a large iridoid producing plant family (Lamiaceae) to generate a set of biosynthetic pathways that best explain the extant iridoid chemical diversity. We developed a pathway reconstruction algorithm that connects iridoid reports via reactions and prunes this solution space by considering phylogenetic relationships between genera. We formulate a model that emulates the evolution of iridoid glucosides to create a synthetic data set, used to select the parameters that would best reconstruct the pathways, and apply them to the iridoid data set to generate pathway hypotheses. These computationally generated pathways were then used as the basis by which to select and screen biosynthetic enzyme candidates. Our model was successfully applied to discover a cytochrome P450 enzyme from Callicarpa americana that catalyzes the oxidation of bartsioside to aucubin, predicted by our model despite neither molecule having been observed in the genus. We also demonstrate aucubin synthase activity in orthologues of Vitex agnus-castus, and the outgroup Paulownia tomentosa, further strengthening the hypothesis, enabled by our model, that the reaction was present in the ancestral biosynthetic pathway. This is the first systematic hypothesis on the epi-iridoid glucosides biosynthesis in 25 years and sets the stage for streamlined work on the iridoid pathway. This work highlights how curation and computational analysis of widely available structural data can facilitate hypothesis-based gene discovery.},

  abstract = {Contemporary bioinformatic and chemoinformatic capabilities hold promise to reshape knowledge management, analysis and interpretation of data in natural products research. Currently, reliance on a disparate set of non-standardized, insular, and specialized databases presents a series of challenges for data access, both within the discipline and for integration and interoperability between related fields. The fundamental elements of exchange are referenced structure-organism pairs that establish relationships between distinct molecular structures and the living organisms from which they were identified. Consolidating and sharing such information via an open platform has strong transformative potential for natural products research and beyond. This is the ultimate goal of the newly established LOTUS initiative, which has now completed the first steps toward the harmonization, curation, validation and open dissemination of 750,000+ referenced structure-organism pairs. LOTUS data is hosted on Wikidata and regularly mirrored on               https://lotus.naturalproducts.net               . Data sharing within the Wikidata framework broadens data access and interoperability, opening new possibilities for community curation and evolving publication models. Furthermore, embedding LOTUS data into the vast Wikidata knowledge graph will facilitate new biological and chemical insights. The LOTUS initiative represents an important advancement in the design and deployment of a comprehensive and collaborative natural products knowledge base.},

As a consequence, in the last 20~years, there was a rapid multiplication of various databases and collections as generalistic or thematic resources for NP information. In this review, we establish a complete overview of these resources, and the numbers are overwhelming: over 120 different NP databases and collections were published and re-used since 2000. 98 of them are still somehow accessible and only 50 are open access. The latter include not only databases but also big collections of NPs published as supplementary material in scientific publications and collections that were backed up in the ZINC database for commercially-available compounds. Some databases, even published relatively recently are already not accessible anymore, which leads to a dramatic loss of data on NPs. The data sources are presented in this manuscript, together with the comparison of the content of open ones. With this review, we also compiled the open-access natural compounds in one single dataset a COlleCtion of Open NatUral producTs (COCONUT), which is available on Zenodo and contains structures and sparse annotations for over 400,000 non-redundant NPs, which makes it the biggest open collection of NPs available to this date.},

This has been fuelled by interest in the central role that microorganisms play in mediating both interspecies interactions and host-microbe relationships. To support the study of natural products chemistry produced by microorganisms we released the Natural Products Atlas, a database of known microbial natural products structures, in 2019. This paper reports the release of a new version of the database which includes a full RESTful application programming interface (API), a new website framework, and an expanded database that includes 8128 new compounds, bringing the total to 32 552. In addition to these structural and content changes we have added full taxonomic descriptions for all microbial taxa and have added chemical ontology terms from both NP Classifier and ClassyFire. We have also performed manual curation to review all entries with incomplete configurational assignments and have integrated data from external resources, including CyanoMetDB. Finally, we have improved the user experience by updating the Overview dashboard and creating a dashboard for taxonomic origin. The database can be accessed via the new interactive website at https://www.npatlas.org.},

  abstract = {Liquid chromatography (LC) coupled to tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is widely used in identifying small molecules in untargeted metabolomics. Various strategies exist to acquire MS/MS fragmentation spectra; however, the development of new acquisition strategies is hampered by the lack of simulators that let researchers prototype, compare, and optimize strategies before validations on real machines. We introduce Virtual Metabolomics Mass Spectrometer (ViMMS), a metabolomics LC-MS/MS simulator framework that allows for scan-level control of the MS2 acquisition process in silico. ViMMS can generate new LC-MS/MS data based on empirical data or virtually re-run a previous LC-MS/MS analysis using pre-existing data to allow the testing of different fragmentation strategies. To demonstrate its utility, we show how ViMMS can be used to optimize N for Top-N data-dependent acquisition (DDA) acquisition, giving results comparable to modifying N on the mass spectrometer. We expect that ViMMS will save method development time by allowing for offline evaluation of novel fragmentation strategies and optimization of the fragmentation strategy for a particular experiment.},

  abstract = {Data-Dependent and Data-Independent Acquisition modes (DDA and DIA, respectively) are both widely used to acquire MS2 spectra in untargeted liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) metabolomics analyses. Despite their wide use, little work has been attempted to systematically compare their MS/MS spectral annotation performance in untargeted settings due to the lack of ground truth and the costs involved in running a large number of acquisitions. Here, we present a systematic               in silico               comparison of these two acquisition methods in untargeted metabolomics by extending our Virtual Metabolomics Mass Spectrometer (ViMMS) framework with a DIA module. Our results show that the performance of these methods varies with the average number of co-eluting ions as the most important factor. At low numbers, DIA outperforms DDA, but at higher numbers, DDA has an advantage as DIA can no longer deal with the large amount of overlapping ion chromatograms. Results from simulation were further validated on an actual mass spectrometer, demonstrating that using ViMMS we can draw conclusions from simulation that translate well into the real world. The versatility of the Virtual Metabolomics Mass Spectrometer (ViMMS) framework in simulating different parameters of both Data-Dependent and Data-Independent Acquisition (DDA and DIA) modes is a key advantage of this work. Researchers can easily explore and compare the performance of different acquisition methods within the ViMMS framework, without the need for expensive and time-consuming experiments with real experimental data. By identifying the strengths and limitations of each acquisition method, researchers can optimize their choice and obtain more accurate and robust results. Furthermore, the ability to simulate and validate results using the ViMMS framework can save significant time and resources, as it eliminates the need for numerous experiments. This work not only provides valuable insights into the performance of DDA and DIA, but it also opens the door for further advancements in LC-MS/MS data acquisition methods.},

  abstract = {Natural products produced by microorganisms constitute an important source of essential pharmaceuticals, including antimicrobial and anti-tumor drugs. These bioactive molecules are microbial secondary metabolites synthesized by co-localized genes termed Biosynthetic Gene Clusters (BGCs). The rapid increase of microbial genomics resources, due to the availability of high-throughput sequencing technologies, has spurred the development of computational methods for microbial genome mining for BGC discovery. Current machine learning methods, however, have limited successes in uncovering novel BGCs due to an excessive number of false positives in their predictions. To this end, we propose Deep-BGCpred, a framework that effectively addresses the aforementioned issue by improving a deep learning model termed DeepBGC. The new model embeds multi-source protein family domains and employs a stacked Bidirectional Long Short-Term Memory model to boost accuracy for BGC identifications. In particular, it integrates two customized strategies, sliding window strategy and dual-model serial screening, to improve the model's performance stability and reduce the number of false positive in BGC predictions. We compare the proposed model against other well-established methods on common benchmarks and achieve new state-of-the-art results with convincing evidences. We expect that researchers working on genome mining for natural products may be greatly benefited from our newly proposed method, Deep-BGCpred.},

  abstract = {Abstract             To evaluate the phylogenetic patterns of the distribution and evolution of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), we selected 8 classes of PSMs and mapped them onto an updated phylogenetic tree including 437 families of seed plants. A significant phylogenetic signal was detected in 17 of the 18 tested seed-plant clades for at least 1 of the 8 PSM classes using the D statistic. The phylogenetic signal, nevertheless, indicated weak clustering of PSMs compared to a random distribution across all seed plants. The observed signal suggests strong diversifying selection during seed-plant evolution and/or relatively weak evolutionary constraints on the evolution of PSMs. In the survey of the current phylogenetic distributions of PSMs, we found that multiple origins of PSM biosynthesis due to external selective forces for diverse genetic pathways may have played important roles. In contrast, a single origin of PSMs seems rather uncommon. The distribution patterns for PSMs observed in this study may also be useful in the search for natural compounds for medicinal purposes.},
