  abstract     = {Contemporary bioinformatic and chemoinformatic capabilities hold promise to reshape knowledge management, analysis and interpretation of data in natural products research. Currently, reliance on a disparate set of non-standardized, insular, and specialized databases presents a series of challenges for data access, both within the discipline and for integration and interoperability between related fields. The fundamental elements of exchange are referenced structure-organism pairs that establish relationships between distinct molecular structures and the living organisms from which they were identified. Consolidating and sharing such information via an open platform has strong transformative potential for natural products research and beyond. This is the ultimate goal of the newly established LOTUS initiative, which has now completed the first steps toward the harmonization, curation, validation and open dissemination of 750,000+ referenced structure-organism pairs. LOTUS data is hosted on Wikidata and regularly mirrored on               https://lotus.naturalproducts.net               . Data sharing within the Wikidata framework broadens data access and interoperability, opening new possibilities for community curation and evolving publication models. Furthermore, embedding LOTUS data into the vast Wikidata knowledge graph will facilitate new biological and chemical insights. The LOTUS initiative represents an important advancement in the design and deployment of a comprehensive and collaborative natural products knowledge base.},

  abstract     = {Abstract                            Natural products (NPs) are small molecules produced by living organisms with potential applications in pharmacology and other industries as many of them are bioactive. This potential raised great interest in NP research around the world and in different application fields, therefore, over the years a multiplication of generalistic and thematic NP databases has been observed. However, there is, at this moment, no online resource regrouping all known NPs in just one place, which would greatly simplify NPs research and allow computational screening and other               in silico               applications. In this manuscript we present the online version of the COlleCtion of Open Natural prodUcTs (COCONUT): an aggregated dataset of elucidated and predicted NPs collected from open sources and a web interface to browse, search and easily and quickly download NPs. COCONUT web is freely available at               https://coconut.naturalproducts.net               .},

To address this need, Metabolic in silico Network Expansions (MINEs) were developed. A MINE is an expansion of known biochemistry which can be used as a list of potential structures for unannotated metabolomics peaks. Here, we present MINE 2.0, which utilizes a new set of biochemical transformation rules that covers 93\% of MetaCyc reactions (compared to 25\% in MINE 1.0). This results in a 17-fold increase in database size and a 40\% increase in MINE database compounds matching unannotated peaks from an untargeted metabolomics dataset. MINE 2.0 is thus a significant improvement to this community resource.
