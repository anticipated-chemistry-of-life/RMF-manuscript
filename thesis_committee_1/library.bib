  abstract     = {Contemporary bioinformatic and chemoinformatic capabilities hold promise to reshape knowledge management, analysis and interpretation of data in natural products research. Currently, reliance on a disparate set of non-standardized, insular, and specialized databases presents a series of challenges for data access, both within the discipline and for integration and interoperability between related fields. The fundamental elements of exchange are referenced structure-organism pairs that establish relationships between distinct molecular structures and the living organisms from which they were identified. Consolidating and sharing such information via an open platform has strong transformative potential for natural products research and beyond. This is the ultimate goal of the newly established LOTUS initiative, which has now completed the first steps toward the harmonization, curation, validation and open dissemination of 750,000+ referenced structure-organism pairs. LOTUS data is hosted on Wikidata and regularly mirrored on               https://lotus.naturalproducts.net               . Data sharing within the Wikidata framework broadens data access and interoperability, opening new possibilities for community curation and evolving publication models. Furthermore, embedding LOTUS data into the vast Wikidata knowledge graph will facilitate new biological and chemical insights. The LOTUS initiative represents an important advancement in the design and deployment of a comprehensive and collaborative natural products knowledge base.},

To address this need, Metabolic in silico Network Expansions (MINEs) were developed. A MINE is an expansion of known biochemistry which can be used as a list of potential structures for unannotated metabolomics peaks. Here, we present MINE 2.0, which utilizes a new set of biochemical transformation rules that covers 93\% of MetaCyc reactions (compared to 25\% in MINE 1.0). This results in a 17-fold increase in database size and a 40\% increase in MINE database compounds matching unannotated peaks from an untargeted metabolomics dataset. MINE 2.0 is thus a significant improvement to this community resource.

However, identifying compounds from tandem mass spectra remains a challenging task due to the incomplete nature of spectral reference libraries. Augmenting these libraries with simulated mass spectra can provide the necessary references to resolve unmatched spectra, but generating high-quality data is difficult. In this study, we present FIORA, an open-source graph neural network designed to simulate tandem mass spectra. Our main contribution lies in utilizing the molecular neighborhood of bonds to learn breaking patterns and derive fragment ion probabilities. FIORA not only surpasses state-of-the-art fragmentation algorithms, ICEBERG and CFM-ID, in prediction quality, but also facilitates the prediction of additional features, such as retention time and collision cross section. Utilizing GPU acceleration, FIORA enables rapid validation of putative compound annotations and large-scale expansion of spectral reference libraries with high-quality predictions.},

However, differentiating molecular fragmentation patterns between isobaric structures remains a prominent challenge in metabolomics [3–10], drug discovery [11–13], and reaction screening [14–17], presenting a significant barrier to the cost-effective and rapid identification of unknown molecular structures. Here, we present a geometric deep learning model, ICEBERG, that simulates collision-induced dissociation in mass spectrometry to generate chemically plausible fragments and their relative intensities with awareness of collision energies and polarities. We utilize ICEBERG predictions to facilitate structure elucidation by ranking a set of candidate structures based on the similarity between their predicted             in silico             MS/MS spectra and an experimental MS/MS spectrum of interest. This integrated elucidation pipeline enables state-of-the-art performance in compound annotation, with 40\% top-1 accuracy on the NIST’20 [M+H]             +             adduct subset and with 92\% of correct structures appearing in the top ten predictions in the same dataset. We demonstrate several real-world case studies, including identifying clinical biomarkers of depression and tuberculous meningitis, annotating an aqueous abiotic degradation product of the pesticide thiophanate methyl, disambiguating isobaric products in pooled reaction screening, and annotating biosynthetic pathways in             Withania somnifera             . Overall, this deep learning-based, chemically-interpretable paradigm for structural elucidation enables rapid molecular annotation from complex mixtures, driving discoveries across diverse scientific domains.},

  abstract   = {The discovery and identification of molecules in biological and environmental samples is crucial for advancing biomedical and chemical sciences. Tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) is the leading technique for high-throughput elucidation of molecular structures. However, decoding a molecular structure from its mass spectrum is exceptionally challenging, even when performed by human experts. As a result, the vast majority of acquired MS/MS spectra remain uninterpreted, thereby limiting our understanding of the underlying (bio)chemical processes. Despite decades of progress in machine learning applications for predicting molecular structures from MS/MS spectra, the development of new methods is severely hindered by the lack of standard datasets and evaluation protocols. To address this problem, we propose MassSpecGym -- the first comprehensive benchmark for the discovery and identification of molecules from MS/MS data. Our benchmark comprises the largest publicly available collection of high-quality labeled MS/MS spectra and defines three MS/MS annotation challenges: de novo molecular structure generation, molecule retrieval, and spectrum simulation. It includes new evaluation metrics and a generalization-demanding data split, therefore standardizing the MS/MS annotation tasks and rendering the problem accessible to the broad machine learning community. MassSpecGym is publicly available at https://github.com/pluskal-lab/MassSpecGym.},

  abstract     = {Abstract             To evaluate the phylogenetic patterns of the distribution and evolution of plant secondary metabolites (PSMs), we selected 8 classes of PSMs and mapped them onto an updated phylogenetic tree including 437 families of seed plants. A significant phylogenetic signal was detected in 17 of the 18 tested seed-plant clades for at least 1 of the 8 PSM classes using the D statistic. The phylogenetic signal, nevertheless, indicated weak clustering of PSMs compared to a random distribution across all seed plants. The observed signal suggests strong diversifying selection during seed-plant evolution and/or relatively weak evolutionary constraints on the evolution of PSMs. In the survey of the current phylogenetic distributions of PSMs, we found that multiple origins of PSM biosynthesis due to external selective forces for diverse genetic pathways may have played important roles. In contrast, a single origin of PSMs seems rather uncommon. The distribution patterns for PSMs observed in this study may also be useful in the search for natural compounds for medicinal purposes.},
